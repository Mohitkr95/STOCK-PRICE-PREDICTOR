# INTRODUCTION TO STOCK MARKET

Broadly, stock market analysis is divided into two parts – Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis.
•	Fundamental Analysis involves analyzing the company’s future profitability on the basis of its current business environment and financial performance.
•	Technical Analysis, on the other hand, includes reading the charts and using statistical figures to identify the trends in the stock market.
